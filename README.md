Changes Made:






Notes when making changes:
Initially in RayTracingAPI I wanted to add List<Sphere> for the list of Sphere Classes, but due to the nature of the original code. 
Refactoring and having even further understanding of the system may force me to re-implement many of the methods. Therefore left it as List<Object> for both Light and Sphere.
